After four people were convicted for the murder of journalist Soumya Vishwanathan in 2008, her mother Madhavi said, "We're not in favour of the death penalty. We want them to suffer like we are suffering." However, she demanded life imprisonment for all four convicted of murder. One other person was convicted of receiving stolen property in the murder case.
