Ravinder Bhalla, the Indian-origin Mayor of US' Hoboken, revealed that he earlier received threat letters via mail. A letter read, "It's time to kill you." Another read, "This is your last warning. If you don't resign...we'll kill you...your wife...[and] your children." Bhalla, who has been living in Hoboken for over 20 years, claimed he's being targeted for his Sikh faith.
